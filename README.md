# AlarmClock
Primary objective is to make a clock display using &amp; Segment Display. Addition of alarm features and making it smarter and smarter in logic design level and coding as well is a Plus!
Update: 
Now it is going to be operated by a UNO, without multiplexing ICs. Instead I will be multiplexing logic in software layer. Schematic will be shared in next update.
